This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of NBA player performance metrics based on data collected from draft combines. The dashboard visualizes various player attributes and comparisons, helping to identify top performers in different categories.

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of multiple visualizations that provide insights into NBA player performance, including:

- **Max of Agility and Max of Sprint by Player**: This bar chart compares players based on their agility and sprint metrics, highlighting those with superior performance in these areas.

- **Players Benched Max Times**: A donut chart showing the distribution of players who have achieved the highest bench press repetitions, identifying strength and endurance leaders.

- **Top 5 Sprinters**: This bar chart displays the top five players with the highest sprinting scores, allowing quick identification of speed leaders.

- **Average of Body Fat and Average of Weight by Player**: A bar chart comparing players' body fat percentages and average weights to understand physical fitness levels.

- **Top 5 Players by Height**: This dual-bar chart compares players' heights with and without shoes, highlighting the tallest players.

- **Top 5 Players by Max Vertical Reach**: A pie chart visualizing the top five players based on their maximum vertical reach, identifying players with exceptional jumping ability.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The data used in this dashboard was sourced from the NBA draft combine datasets and was cleaned using Power Query. The data cleaning process involved:

1. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensured that each playerâ€™s data was unique by removing any duplicate entries.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed any missing or incomplete data by filling in values where appropriate or removing those records from the analysis.

3. **Standardizing Formats**: Standardized data formats to ensure consistency across different datasets, such as converting height and weight measurements to uniform units.

4. **Filtering Data**: Filtered the data to include only relevant years and players for the analysis, specifically focusing on draft classes from 2012, 2013, and 2015.

5. **Creating Calculated Columns**: Added calculated columns to derive metrics such as average body fat percentage and average weight, which were used in visualizations.
